GUESSER GAME
___________________

This is a sample game which I developed using Java to understand object-oriented programming thoroughly.
 
Concept of Game:
 the game contains 5 players. Umpire, Guesser and three Players.
The guesser guesses a number between 1 and 10 and tell it to the umpire secretly. And the remaining 3 players try to  predict the number guessed by   guesser. 
The one who predicts the number guessed by the guesser correctly is the winner of the game.
 If  more than one Player predicts the number correctly, all of them are winners.

Added features:
⇒ Restricted the all the players and guesser to guess  a number between 1 and 10. Even if they predict/guess a number out of this range, then the program will prompt to re-enter the input until they're choosing a value with in allowed range.


⇒ added a counter to print player numbers in the console. 

⇒ Print summary of the game after finding the winner. The summary includes Accuracy of prediction of players who lost the game.
    Accuracy is displayed in terms of, how close number predicted by players towards the number guesser by guesser.
